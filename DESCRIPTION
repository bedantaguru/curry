Description: Currying is the process of partially calling a function, one
    argument at a time. The curry package provides this functionality through
    the %>>% operator which allows you to apply one argument at a time. Compared
    to other implementations such a purrr::partial the %>>% operator composes
    functions with named arguments, aiding in autocomplete etc.
